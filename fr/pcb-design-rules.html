				PCB Design Rules – Design Review Checklist
				</h1>
				<p>
				  Passing your ECAD tool’s <strong>ERC</strong> (Electrical Rules Check) and
				  <strong>DRC</strong> (Design Rule Check) is necessary, but
				  <strong>does not guarantee a successful PCB</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
				  ERC / DRC mainly catch schematic connectivity, pin-type issues, and layout
				  manufacturability constraints.
				</p>

				<p>
				  This practical PCB design rules cheat sheet and design review checklist for
				  low-noise, reliable, and manufacturable printed circuit boards walks you
				  through the key engineering checks, with explanations, that <strong>go beyond what
				  standard ERC / DRC checks can verify</strong>:
				</p>

				<div class="grid">
				  <ul>
					<li>EMC / EMI control</li>
					<li>Noise reduction</li>
					<li>Return-path &amp; loop-area control</li>
					<li>Stack-up &amp; plane strategy</li>
					<li>Signal integrity</li>
					<li>Power integrity</li>
				  </ul>

				  <ul>
					<li>ESD &amp; surge robustness</li>
					<li>Creepage &amp; clearance safety</li>
					<li>High-current &amp; thermal management</li>
					<li>Mechanical constraints</li>
					<li>Design-for-test (DFT) &amp; probe access</li>
				  </ul>

					Confirm your PCB manufacturer’s real fabrication and assembly process limits early (standard vs. advanced capability, minimum trace width and spacing, via sizes, annular rings, solder-mask and silkscreen limits, copper weight, layer count, stack-up, tolerances, panelisation, component spacing and heights).
					Configure your ECAD design rules conservatively to match these capabilities — <strong>before you place or route anything</strong>.
					This ensures the design is buildable with good yield and reasonable cost from the start, prevents unmanufacturable features, and avoids costly late-stage rework.
					<br><br>
					As part of these constraints, ensure sufficient physical clearance for automated pick-and-place heads, manual assembly during prototyping, and access for a soldering-iron tip if rework or repair is required.
