				<p>
					To support a client conducting large-scale hydrographical survey operations, 
					JAK Services designed and developed a component-based automated onboard hydrographic 
					data-processing pipeline. Its purpose was to automatically and continuously generate 
					a preliminary dataset closely approximating the final processed data, enabling rapid 
					detection of areas requiring re-survey before the vessel had moved too far from the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The pipeline was fully orchestrable and integrated seamlessly with—while complementing—existing workflows, 
					such as <a href="https://www.eiva.com">EIVA’s Workflow Manager (WFM)</a> for Multi Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) data. The orchestration application 
					was designed to be payload-agnostic and could also be used with Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) and other sensor types.
				</p>
				<p>
					The pipeline illustrated in the image below featured:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Real-time payload streaming with automated file rotation at defined intervals and end-of-line, saving to EIVA’s .SBD format. For MBES data, this component was only used when EIVA NaviScan was not used for logging.</li>
					<li>Automated processing of ancillary data such as SVP and navigation (for navigation generated via post-processing APIs, the system continuously produced navigation files with run-in/out extensions for each new SBD).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Once generated—and after any corresponding ancillary data was processed—the SBD files were continuously sorted 
					according to active site and area names, then automatically imported and organized into EIVA WorkFlow Manager (WFM) for 
					linking with ancillary data, cleaning, and exporting as point-cloud files.
				</p>
				<p>
					These point-cloud files were then processed by the JAK Services–developed orchestration application, which executed 
					command-line tools to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Perform gridding</li>
					<li>Generate QC products such as density maps, gap polygons, and sizing metrics</li>
					<li>Produce go/no-go traffic-light matrices aligned with WFM conventions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The orchestration application then generated low-volume GIS deliverables—including DTM, grayscale and color 
					shaded reliefs, track plots, slope maps, red/green density charts, coverage layers, gap polygons, and more—ready 
					for transfer to a web portal for visualization and download.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the same applications were used to export the final merged deliverables once the data had been 
					quality-checked by an operator.
